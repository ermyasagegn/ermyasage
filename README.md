Fun fact: I love dealing with challenging problems and exploring new tech!

Plan for the future( not literal future but in sometime) : I want to build problem-solving Raspberry Pi projects, as it is what I want to learn next to what I am on right now!


I will push the projects I built that I believe will be useful for others here!
